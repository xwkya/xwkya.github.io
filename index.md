* 21 Earth laps around the sun
* Machine Learning Engineer and Mathematician


I'm currently in a double diploma Msc by research at the **National University of Singapore**. I have studied in French top Engineering School **Centrale Supélec** for my Masters degree, focusing on fundamental Mathematics and Engineering. I hold a Bachelor's degree in mathematics from the #1 school in mathematics in the world [#1 school in mathematics in the world ](https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/gras/2021/RS0101), **Université Paris-Saclay**. I have studied in the intense _classe Préparatoire aux grandes Ecoles_ **Lycée Thiers** for 2 years to prepare for the entrance examination for Engineering School.

> My main motivation is to make models that will one day impress the world

## Mathematics projects

Here is a small sample of the projects related to mathematics that I have worked on.

### Onera Liner Optimisation

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
